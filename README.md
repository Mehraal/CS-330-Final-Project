# CS-330-Final-Project
How do I approach designing software?
. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? this course helped me understand how each detail would affect the design created. 
. What design process did you follow for your project work? the design process I followed was to first understand what I required for the design and what tools and features were needed to create a design that closely resembled the intended design.
. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? the tactics used in this design are to break it down and look at it from every angle to better understand every piece of the project and this process could be used for every [project in the future.
How do I approach developing programs?
. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? During each milestone, I learned how each feature could affect how the design would look and how effective and realistic it would be when users interact with it, and each milestone was a stepping stone for the next.
. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? in today's world, everything rely on computers and graphics, my goal is to use this knowledge to improve user interaction with the programs and help the efficiency and scalability of the programs.
. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
